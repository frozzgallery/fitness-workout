Is planet fitness black card no commitment? Your membership card can’t be used by anyone else. Black card membership those who want better or unlimited access to all the equipment, including the total body enhancement, planet fitness tanning, and hydromassage will need to upgrade to the black card membership. I think the black card is worth it because you get $1 bottles of water (adds up over time), and access to the sauna/spa rooms. They can be as low as $1 if a promotion is on, but may be as high as $49.</p>
