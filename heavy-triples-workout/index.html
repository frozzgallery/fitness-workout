<p>I would suggest implementing triples this way: If you want the training effect to be slightly more strength oriented, don�t take much weight off the bar, keep your reps low, and only do a few more sets. Make sure you have a spotter standing by. They could do one set, or ten sets, it doesn�t matter. 5 x 3 x.</p>
