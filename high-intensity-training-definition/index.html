<p>Nautilus inventor arthur jones helped define and popularize hit in the 1970’s, often summarizing the general philosophy as “…train harder, but train briefer” or “…train harder, but train less often”. You might simply look at this definition of intensity in terms of ‘difficultly’. The training focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure. Now multiply 95 by 0.85 (85%) to get 80.75, then add your resting heart rate of 80 to get 160.75.</p>
