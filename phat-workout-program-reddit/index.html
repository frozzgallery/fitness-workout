<h3 id="each-muscle-gets-worked-2xweek">Each muscle gets worked 2x/week.</h3><p>Not only is rest an essential component to actual recovery, but also to performance.

After doing phat a short while, i am fairly sure the 2 strength training days just aren�t enough to make significant strength gains. It is crucially important that you take your rest days seriously. This is followed by a rest day.</p>

<p>While the phul workout has a somewhat standardized scheduled, many weight lifters have experienced different levels of success with alterations to the regimen. This is followed by a rest day. There are two “power” workouts and three hypertrophy workouts. 2 days focus on power and 3 days focus on hypertrophy. One such program we always recommend is phat, layne norton�s.</p>

<p>So you know the standard (well known, generic, survived the test of time) free bodybuilding programs out there aren�t precisely many, and that there are even fewer ones for high intermediates/lower advanced.

<p>So far i�m liking phat and my workout is cut in half. The principles there are several dozen forms of the phat program but the basic premise is the same.
