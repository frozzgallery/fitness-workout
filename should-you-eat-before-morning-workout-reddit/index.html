<p>It varies from person to person, in all honesty. If your exercising goal is to lose excessive body weight, you will do just fine by having about 10g of branched chain amino acids half an hour before your workout.

<p>Despite what you may have heard, working out fasted doesn’t lead to more fat loss and instead allows for excessive muscle breakdown during and after working out. Snack before the workout, full breakfast after. You could have some protein shake 30min before your workout. Others prefer to eat some light carbs like a banana or some other type of fruit.</p>
