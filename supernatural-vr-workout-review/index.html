<p>Luckily, my oculus quest vr headset has been all i’ve needed to get a good sweat on during a workout. This isn�t the kind of vr that lets you sit and swivel around in a chair.

<p>There are many fitness games available for the oculus quest 2, so supernatural’s subscription model. A vr workout app killed my quads supernatural is surprisingly effective, if you have the space and money. “supernatural,” on the other hand, makes full use of your ability to rotate in every single workout.

<p>Another really great way that it allows you to move is. Supernatural is a great vr game with a cardio upside, but its emphasis on speed, repetitive squatting, and lunging could cause problems.

<p>The experience is mainly limited to daily flow workouts and some boxing workouts. Supernatural vr uses music, landscapes, and fitness coaches to get you a workout you can do at home.
